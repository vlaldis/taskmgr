# Planovac uloh

Sample task scheduller with React and aincient Net 4.8 (seriously, who does still use it?)

Timebox: 6 hours

The code is buildable, runnable but FE and BE are not integrated together and do not comunicate at all.
This solution should deal as code sample, not full solution (at least, that is my understanding).

What works:
- BE build
- full BE API
- FE build
- FE views partialy
- FE client for BE calls (history part is missing)
- sample global error handling
- sql connection with EF (localDB)

What is missing:
- Unit tests for both FE and BE
- Authentication
- logging
- history tabble
- FE client for quering history
- integration of FE and BE

Remaining work is not finalized as my timebox for this project expired.
